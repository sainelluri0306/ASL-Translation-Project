## Overview
The **ASL Flex Glove** is a personal project translating **American Sign Language (ASL)** letters using **flex sensors** and a **microcontroller**.  
It demonstrates how sensor data and embedded programming can be applied to create **assistive technology** for improved communication and accessibility.

---

## Hardware
- Flex sensors (5x, one per finger)  
- Microcontroller: Arduino Nano (or equivalent)  
- 10kŒ© resistors for voltage dividers  
- Power source (USB or 9V battery)  
- PCB (final version replaces breadboard)
- 3D Printed Case for Structural Support
- Optional: Bluetooth/Wi-Fi module  

---

## Code
Arduino code is included in the [ASL-Translation-Project.ino](ASL-Translation-Project-Code.ino) file.
It reads flex sensor values and maps them to ASL letters.

---

## PCB & Circuit Schematic
All schematics, PCB layouts, and 3D simulations can be found in the 
[pcb-and-circuit-schematics.md](PCB-and-Circuit-Schematics.md) file.

---

## üñäÔ∏è 3D CAD Design
In addition to the circuit and PCB, a **3D CAD design** was created to support the glove and house the electronics for stability.  

All CAD files and renderings are included in the  
[ASL-case-3d-cad-design.md](ASL-case-3d-cad.design.md) file.

---

## Future Improvements
- Calibrate flex sensors for higher accuracy  
- Expand recognition from letters to full words/phrases  
- Add wireless data transfer to a mobile app  
- Develop a wearable glove using 3D printing  
- Miniaturize PCB for a portable, production-ready design
