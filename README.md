## Overview
The **ASL Flex Glove** is a personal project translating **American Sign Language (ASL)** letters using **flex sensors** and a **microcontroller**.  
It demonstrates how sensor data and embedded programming can be applied to create **assistive technology** for improved communication and accessibility.

---

## Hardware
- Flex sensors (5x, one per finger)  
- Microcontroller: Arduino Nano (or equivalent)  
- 10kÎ© resistors for voltage dividers  
- Power source (USB or battery pack)  
- PCB (final version replaces breadboard)  
- Optional: Bluetooth/Wi-Fi module  

---

## Code
Arduino code is included in the ASL-Translation-Project.ino file.
It reads flex sensor values and maps them to ASL letters.

## Future Improvements
- Calibrate flex sensors for higher accuracy  
- Expand recognition from letters to full words/phrases  
- Add wireless data transfer to a mobile app  
- Develop a wearable glove using 3D printing  
- Miniaturize PCB for a portable, production-ready design
